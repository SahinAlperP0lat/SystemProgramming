# Docker & DevOps – Week 1 Report

## Student Role
Role: Docker and DevOps Engineer  
Responsible Student: Ali Emir Nur

---

## Purpose of Docker Usage
Docker is used in this project to ensure:
- Consistent development environment for all team members
- Isolation of services (Application & Database)
- Easy deployment and testing using containerization
- Platform-independent execution

---

## Planned Docker Architecture

The system will consist of two Docker containers:

### 1. PostgreSQL Database Container
- Base Image: postgres:15 (official image)
- Purpose: Store student information persistently
- Data Persistence: Docker Volume
- Environment Variables:
  - POSTGRES_USER
  - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
  - POSTGRES_DB

### 2. C++ Application Container
- Base Image: ubuntu:22.04
- Responsibilities:
  - Connect to PostgreSQL database
  - Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Build Tools:
  - g++
  - cmake
  - libpqxx (PostgreSQL C++ client)

---

## Docker Networking Plan
- Docker Compose will create a private bridge network
- Containers will communicate using service names
- Database will NOT be exposed to the host directly

---

## Volume Management
- A named Docker volume will be used for PostgreSQL
- This ensures data persistence even if containers are stopped or removed

Example:
- Volume Name: db_data
- Mount Path: /var/lib/postgresql/data

---

## Planned Docker Files (Week 1)
The following Docker-related files will be created during the project:

- docker-compose.yml  
- docker/Dockerfile.app  
- docker/.dockerignore  

These files will be implemented starting from Week 2.

---

## Docker Hub Plan
- Docker Hub account will be created using school email
- Public images will be pushed for evaluation
- Planned image names:

  - <dockerhub_username>/sis-project-postgres
  - <dockerhub_username>/sis-project-app

Docker Hub links will be added to README.md once images are pushed.

---

## Week 1 Summary
In the first week:
- Docker architecture planning was completed
- Container responsibilities were clearly defined
- Volume and network structure was designed
- Docker implementation is planned for Week 2
